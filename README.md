# imagenoisefilter
The goal of this project was to explore methods of image processing in MATLAB by expanding the use of FIR filters into two dimensions. A brain BMP scan was used as the base image signal. Noise was randomly added to each pixel of the base image. Two FIR filters were tested to analyze and compare their performance in terms of SNR improvement and output image quality. 

See Woelfel_ImageNoiseFilter.pdf for a report on the results of the project.
